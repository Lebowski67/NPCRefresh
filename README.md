# NPCRefresh

A GTA V mod that refreshes gameplay by adding custom mechanics and overriding NPC AI to make interactions more dynamic and fun.

## Features

### Custom AI Override
Under certain circumstances, the mod replaces the built-in NPC AI with a custom system designed to add new behaviors to NPCs

### NPC Memory System
NPCs remember notable interactions with the player:
- **Combat Memory**: If an NPC fought you before, they'll attack on sight next time
- **Fear Memory**: NPCs who fled from you will continue to flee in future encounters

This is especially fun with gangs.

### Extended NPC Persistence
The mod prevents NPCs involved in notable events from despawning too quickly when near the player. This includes keeping dead bodies visible for longer periods.

### Interactive Controls

**B Button** (Control index 29):
- Greet nearby pedestrians
- Use vending machines (food increases health, drinks increase armor)
- Enter nearby vehicles as a passenger

**G Button** (Control index 47):
- Insult nearby pedestrians
- Push pedestrians (when close enough)
